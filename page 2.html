		<h1 style="color: white">What is information technology?</h1>
		<p style="color: white">Information technology (IT) is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, <br>infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data. Typically, <br>IT is used in the context of business operations, as opposed to technology used for personal or entertainment purposes. <br>The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.</p>
		<p style="color: white">The Harvard Business Review coined the term information technology to make a distinction between purpose-built machines <br>esigned to perform a limited scope of functions, and general-purpose computing machines that could be programmed for various tasks. <br>As the IT industry evolved from the mid-20th century, computing capability increased, while device cost and energy consumption decreased, <br>a cycle that continues today when new technologies emerge.</p><br>
		<h1 style="color: white">Why is information technology important?</h1>
		<p style="color: white">It's been said that data is what powers industries worldwide. That may be hyperbole, but few businesses large or small <br>can remain competitive without the ability to collect data and turn it into useful information. <br>IT provides the means to develop, process, analyze, exchange, store and secure information.</p>
		<h1 style="color: white">Careers in information technology</h1>
		<p style="color: white">A team of administrators and other technical staffers deploy and manage a company's IT infrastructure and assets. <br>IT teams depend on a range of specialized information and technology skills and knowledge to support equipment, applications and activities. <br>Third-party contractors and IT vendor support personnel augment the IT team.The information technology profession is extremely diverse. <br>IT workers can specialize in fields such as software development; application management; hardware components; server, storage <br>or network administration; network architecture; and more. Many businesses seek IT professionals with mixed or overlapping skill sets.</p>
